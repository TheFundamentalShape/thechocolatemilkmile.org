            <p class="skippy-font text-brown text-2xl">
                On December 4th, 2018, the running community lost Noah
                Farrelly, a freshman at Stony Brook University. Noah was
                struck and killed by a vehicle out on a training run. The
                New York running community has always been very close,
                and we all knew how genuinely kind and loving of a person
                Noah was. Noah participated in this event in 2018, and
                although we found that he did not have the strongest stomach,
                gagging up most of the milk, you can tell from his smile
                he had an amazing time. In an effort to spread Noah’s legacy
                and kind heart, we have renamed the Boy’s fastest heat of the
                mile to the Noah Farrelly Championship Mile. Last year we
                donated over 25 pairs of shoes and spikes, and $700 to the
                Noah Farrelly Memorial Fund. If you would like to hear more
                about the story, you can visit their <a href="http://www.noahfarrellyrun.org/about/the-noah-farrelly-memorial-fund/" target="_blank" class="underline">website</a>.

                This year will be our third event put on at Burnt Hills.
                The first year, we only had 20 participants. We were able
                to raise that number to 45 the second year, and then 80
                this past year. Each year we have grown the event and
                expanded our horizon to more people.</p>
